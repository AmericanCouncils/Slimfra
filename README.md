# Slimfra #

Slimfra is a thin extension of the Silex microframework for building small(ish) projects.  It assumes a default project structure to help keep the project organized as it grows.  It provides a configurable base application, a simple base controller, and default configuration for commonly used services.

For documentation on the excellent Silex framework, and examples of how to use it (all of which applies to Slimfra), refer to the [Silex documentation](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/).

Slimfra was built for personal use and rapid app development at work in order to easily convert some simple legacy projects into an easier to manage structure.  Why is it named Slimfra?  Because.

If anyone wishes to contribute, please do, but we recommend contributing to Silex for things that would be of benefit to the broader community.
